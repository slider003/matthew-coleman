# Welcome to My Blog

I'm excited to launch my new personal website and blog! This site is built with modern web technologies and serves as a space where I can share my thoughts, experiences, and knowledge.

## What You'll Find Here

On this blog, I'll be writing about:

- **Technology**: Insights on software development, web technologies, and emerging trends
- **Personal Projects**: Updates and reflections on projects I'm working on
- **Learning**: Sharing what I learn as I continue to grow as a developer

## About This Site

This website is built using:

- **Next.js** - React framework for production
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **Pages CMS** - Git-based content management
- **GitHub Pages** - Free and reliable hosting

The site features a clean, minimalist design with dark mode support. It's fully static, which means it loads fast and works reliably.

## Stay Tuned

I'll be publishing more posts soon. Feel free to check back regularly or subscribe to the RSS feed (coming soon!).

Thanks for visiting!
